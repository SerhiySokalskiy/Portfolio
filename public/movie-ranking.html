<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Seven</h3>
<p>It's my favorite detective movie I've ever seen.</p>
<h3>Pulp fiction</h3>
<p>This film is my favorite film directed by Tarantino. I can't define the genre of this film but I guess it is about everything.</p>
<h3>Fight club</h3>
<p>My best psychologic thriller is Fight club. And yes, Bred Pitt acted perfectly.</p>
